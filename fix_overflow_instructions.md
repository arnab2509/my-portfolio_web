# Overflow Fixes for Portfolio Web

## Changes Made to Fix Overflow Issues

### 1. SkillCard Widget
- Removed fixed height constraint that was causing overflow
- Reduced padding and spacing to make layout more compact
- Decreased text and icon sizes for better fit on small screens
- Simplified the layout by removing unnecessary Flexible widgets
- Made progress bar thinner and more compact

### 2. ProjectCard Widget
- Added SizedBox with fixed width to control card size
- Improved button layout with more compact spacing
- Made tags smaller and more compact
- Added overflow protection with ellipsis

### 3. SkillsSection
- Reduced the number of columns in grid for larger screens
- Increased childAspectRatio to make cards shorter
- Decreased padding and spacing for better layout
- Made section title responsive
- Added adaptive layout that switches between GridView and Wrap based on screen size
- Created a separate method to build skills grid with better flexibility
- Added special handling for very small screens or many skills

## Running the App

To run the application and check the fixed layout:

```
cd portfolio_web
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

If you encounter any layout issues:
1. Try adjusting the browser window size to see responsiveness
2. Check the console for any remaining overflow errors
3. If needed, further reduce sizes or increase spacing based on specific errors

## Additional Recommendations

For even better responsive layout:
- Consider using a ListView instead of GridView for very small screens
- Implement a maximum width constraint on larger containers
- Use a minimum font size threshold to ensure text remains readable
