# Fixes for GetX State Management Issues

## Red Screen Error
The app was showing a red screen error with the message:
```
setState() or markNeedsBuild() called during build.
This GetBuilder<GetMaterialController> widget cannot be marked as needing to build because the framework is already in the process of building widgets.
```

## Root Causes and Fixes

1. **State Updates During Build Phase**
   - **Problem**: The app was attempting to update state during the build phase, which is not allowed in Flutter
   - **Fix**: Wrapped all reactive state updates with `Obx()` to ensure proper reactivity, and used `Future.microtask()` for state updates in `_updateCurrentSectionOnScroll()` method

2. **Desktop and Mobile Layouts**
   - **Problem**: Direct access to controller state properties during the build process
   - **Fix**: Wrapped all reactive data access with `Obx()` widgets to ensure updates happen outside the build method

3. **HomeController Initialization**
   - **Problem**: Controller may have been recreated multiple times with `lazyPut`
   - **Fix**: Changed from `Get.lazyPut()` to `Get.put()` with `permanent: true` to ensure the controller is initialized once and persisted throughout the app lifecycle

4. **View Initialization**
   - **Problem**: HomeView did not explicitly ensure the controller was initialized before building
   - **Fix**: Added `Get.find<HomeController>()` in the build method to ensure controller initialization

5. **App Routes**
   - **Problem**: Inconsistent widget creation in routes
   - **Fix**: Updated routes to use `const` widgets for consistency

## Additional Improvements

1. **Loading States**:
   - Added proper loading indicators with `Obx(() => controller.isLoading.value ? LoadingIndicator() : Content())`

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling in data loading methods

3. **GetX Best Practices**:
   - Used `GetView<T>` to ensure proper controller access
   - Used reactive `.obs` properties and `Obx()` wrappers instead of `GetBuilder`
   - Properly initialized controllers in the binding

## Next Steps

1. Run the app to verify all issues are resolved
2. Check if any section components need similar reactive wrapper updates
3. Consider adding proper error boundary widgets
4. Ensure all scrolling and section navigation works correctly with the new reactive approach
