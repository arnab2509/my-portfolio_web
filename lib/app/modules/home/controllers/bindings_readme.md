# GetX Implementation Changes

## Changes Made

1. **Converted StatefulWidget to StatelessWidget using GetX**
   - Created a new `ContactController` that extends GetxController
   - Converted the `ContactForm` widget to use GetX reactive state management
   - Registered the controller in the `HomeBinding`

2. **Removed Unused Code**
   - Removed the unnecessary `MyHomePage` StatefulWidget from `main.dart`
   - Cleaned up boilerplate code that was not needed

3. **Default Theme Configuration**
   - Set the default theme mode to light in `main.dart`

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Error with 'roles' property**
   - There's an error indicating that the getter 'roles' isn't defined for the type 'Rx<ProfileModel>'
   - The ProfileModel doesn't have a 'roles' property according to its definition
   - Need to find any code that's trying to access `controller.profile.roles` and update it to use the correct property:
     - The closest properties in ProfileModel are 'title' and 'subtitle' which are already used for the animated text
     - The ProfileModel contains: name, title, subtitle, email, phone, location, about, avatar, projects, skills, education, experience, and socialLinks

2. **GetX Package Installation**
   - Make sure the GetX package is properly installed by running `flutter pub get`
   - Ensure all imports are correct

## Next Steps

1. Search through the codebase for any references to "roles" and update them
2. Test the app to ensure all components are working correctly with GetX state management
3. Verify that theme switching is working as expected
