# Updated Fixes for GetX State Management Issues

## Red Screen Error
The app was showing a red screen error with the message:
```
setState() or markNeedsBuild() called during build.
This GetBuilder<GetMaterialController> widget cannot be marked as needing to build because the framework is already in the process of building widgets.
```

## Additional Fixes Implemented

1. **Removed Controller Finding During Build**
   - Removed `Get.find<HomeController>()` call during the `build` method of `HomeView`
   - GetView<T> handles controller access automatically, no need to manually find it

2. **Added Anti-recursion Protection**
   - Added an `_isUpdating` flag to prevent recursive state updates
   - All state change methods check this flag before updating

3. **Deferred State Changes with Future.microtask**
   - Wrapped ALL state changes in `Future.microtask()` to ensure they happen after the current build frame
   - Applied to `toggleTheme()`, `changeSection()`, `scrollToSection()`, and `_updateCurrentSectionOnScroll()`

4. **Proper Controller Initialization**
   - Modified `HomeBinding` to clear existing controller instances before creating new ones
   - Used `Get.put()` with `permanent: true` for both controllers
   - Added `Get.deleteAll(force: true)` in main.dart before app initialization

5. **Made Navigation Fully Reactive**
   - Wrapped all text widgets displaying controller data with Obx in `CustomNavigationBar`
   - Ensured theme toggling doesn't trigger during build

6. **GetMaterialApp Improvements**
   - Added `enableLog: true` for better debugging
   - Added a builder function with error boundary
   - Simplified and removed unnecessary parameters

## Root Causes Identified

The primary issue was that GetX was attempting to update the GetMaterialController during the build phase, which Flutter doesn't allow. This happens when:

1. State changes are triggered during the build method
2. Controller initialization occurs during build
3. Obx wrappers are missing around reactive data
4. Multiple updates happen in quick succession without proper debouncing

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the app and verify no red screen errors appear
2. Test all interactive features, especially navigation and theme toggling
3. Check if section scrolling works correctly
4. Validate that the profile data loads and displays properly
5. Make sure ContactForm submission works correctly

This comprehensive approach should resolve all instances of the "setState() or markNeedsBuild() called during build" error.
